# Bitcoin Challenge Blazor

## Task 

The following GET request provide data about the current price of an bitcoin in Euro:
https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/spot?currency=EUR 

Code a small sample that show that price on a web page using one of the following technology stacks : 
* ASP Net Core Razor pages (>2.0) 
* ASP Net Core Blazor (>2.0) 
* If one of that frameworks does not fit, then choose an own frameworks and inform us about the choice
 
The optic of the page does not really matter. The basic Bootstrap template is more than enough.
 
## Optional 
Let the value be refreshed in a cyclic way as long as the page is visible. The value (like 10s,..) should be possible to configure with application settings. 

## Remarks 
The time for this task should not take longer than 2h. There is no special environment setup requested. (VS Code, Visual Studio,..)
